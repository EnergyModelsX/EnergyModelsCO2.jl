    generate_co2_retrofit_example_data()

Generate the data for an example consisting of a simple CO₂ retrofit system.
It does not directly utilize the investment potential, but showcases how the nodes should
be created.

In this case, 100 % of the CO₂ emissions from the CCGT are routed to a CO₂ capture node in
which 90 % of said CO₂ emissions are captured. In addition, this capture unit requires
1 MWh NG/t CO₂ input of which also 90 % is captured.
